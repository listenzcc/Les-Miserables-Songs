<p><strong>CHAIN GANG</strong></p>

<p>Look down, look down</p>

<p>Don’t look ’em in the eye</p>

<p>Look down, look down</p>

<p>You’re here until you die.</p>

<p>The sun is strong</p>

<p>It’s hot as hell below</p>

<p>Look down, look down</p>

<p>There’s twenty years to go.</p>

<p>I’ve done no wrong</p>

<p>Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer</p>

<p>Look down, look down</p>

<p>Sweet Jesus doesn’t care</p>

<p>I know she’ll wait</p>

<p>I know that she’ll be true</p>

<p>Look down, look down</p>

<p>They’ve all forgotten you</p>

<p>When I get free</p>

<p>You won’t see me</p>

<p>Here for dust</p>

<p>Look down, look down</p>

<p>Don’t look ’em in the eye.</p>

<p>How long, 0 Lord,</p>

<p>Before you let me die?</p>

<p>Look down, look down</p>

<p>You’ll always be a slave</p>

<p>Look down, look down,</p>

<p>You’re standing in your grave.</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>Now bring me prisoner 24601</p>

<p>Your time is up</p>

<p>And your parole’s begun</p>

<p>You know what that means,</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Yes, it means I’m free.</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>No! It means You get</p>

<p>Your yellow ticket-of-leave</p>

<p>You are a thief.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>I stole a loaf of bread.</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>You robbed a house.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>I broke a window pane.</p>

<p>My sister’s child was close to death</p>

<p>And we were starving.</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>You will starve again</p>

<p>Unless you learn the meaning of the law.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>I know the meaning of those 19 years</p>

<p>A slave of the law.</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>Five years for what you did</p>

<p>The rest because you tried to run</p>

<p>Yes, 24601.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>My name is Jean Valjean.</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>And I’m Javert</p>

<p>Do not forget my name</p>

<p>Do not forget me</p>

<p>24601.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="on-parole--the-bishop">ON PAROLE / THE BISHOP</h3>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Freedom is mine. The earth is still.</p>

<p>I feel the wind. I breathe again</p>

<p>And the sky clears</p>

<p>The world is waking</p>

<p>Drink from the pool. How clean the taste</p>

<p>Never forget the years, the waste</p>

<p>Nor forgive them</p>

<p>For what they’ve done</p>

<p>They are the guilty—every one</p>

<p>The day begins</p>

<p>And now let’s see</p>

<p>What this new world</p>

<p>Will do for me</p>

<p><strong>EMPLOYER</strong></p>

<p>You’ll have to go</p>

<p>I’ll pay you off for the day</p>

<p>Collect your bits and pieces there</p>

<p>And be on your way</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>You have given me half</p>

<p>What the other men get</p>

<p>This handful of tin</p>

<p>Wouldn’t buy my sweat</p>

<p><strong>LABORER</strong></p>

<p>You’ve broke the law</p>

<p>It’s there for people to see</p>

<p>Why should you get the same</p>

<p>As honest men like me.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>And now I know how freedom feels</p>

<p>The jailer always at your heels.</p>

<p>It is the law</p>

<p>This piece of paper in my hand</p>

<p>That makes me cast throughout the land.</p>

<p>It is the law</p>

<p>Like a cur</p>

<p>I walk the street</p>

<p>The dirt beneath their feet.</p>

<p><strong>BISHOP</strong></p>

<p>Come in, Sir, for you are weary</p>

<p>And the night is cold out there</p>

<p>Though our lives are very humble</p>

<p>What we have we have to share</p>

<p>There is wine here to revive you</p>

<p>There is bread to make you strong</p>

<p>There’s a bed to rest till morning</p>

<p>Rest from pain, and rest from wrong</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>He let me eat my fill</p>

<p>I have the lion’s share</p>

<p>The silver in my hand</p>

<p>Cost twice what I had earned</p>

<p>In all those nineteen years</p>

<p>That lifetime of despair</p>

<p>And yet he trusted me</p>

<p>The old fool trusted me</p>

<p>He’d done his bit of good</p>

<p>I played the grateful serf</p>

<p>And thanked him like I should</p>

<p>And when the house was still</p>

<p>I got up in the night</p>

<p>Took the silver</p>

<p>Took my flight!</p>

<p><strong>CONSTABLES</strong></p>

<p>Tell His Reverence your story.</p>

<p>Let us see if he’s impressed.</p>

<p>You were lodging here last night.</p>

<p>You were the honest Bishop’s guest.</p>

<p>And then, out of Christian goodness.</p>

<p>When he learned about your plight</p>

<p>You maintain he made a present of this silver</p>

<p><strong>BISHOP</strong></p>

<p>That is right.</p>

<p>But my friend, you left so early</p>

<p>Surely something slipped your mind.</p>

<p>You forgot I gave these also</p>

<p>Would you leave the best behind?</p>

<p>So, Messieurs, you may release him</p>

<p>For this man has spoken true.</p>

<p>I commend you for your duty</p>

<p>And God’s blessing go with you.</p>

<p>But remember this, my brother</p>

<p>See in this some higher plan.</p>

<p>You must use this precious silver</p>

<p>To become an honest man.</p>

<p>By the witness of the martyrs</p>

<p>By the Passion and the Blood</p>

<p>God has raised you out of darkness</p>

<p>I have bought your soul for God!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="valjeans-soliloquy">VALJEAN’S SOLILOQUY</h3>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>What have I done?</p>

<p>Sweet Jesus, what have I done?</p>

<p>Become a thief in the night!</p>

<p>Become a dog on the run!</p>

<p>And have I fallen so far</p>

<p>And is the hour so late</p>

<p>That nothing remains but the cry of my hate,</p>

<p>The cries in the dark that nobody hears</p>

<p>Here where I stand at the turning of the years?</p>

<p>If there’s another way to go</p>

<p>I missed it twenty long years ago.</p>

<p>My life was a war that could never be won</p>

<p>They gave me a number and murdered Valjean</p>

<p>When they chained Me and left me for dead</p>

<p>Just for stealing a mouthful of bread.</p>

<p>Yet why did I allow this man</p>

<p>To touch my soul and teach me love?</p>

<p>He treated me like any other.</p>

<p>He gave me his trust.</p>

<p>He called me Brother.</p>

<p>My life he claims for God above.</p>

<p>Can such things be?</p>

<p>For I had come to hate the world.</p>

<p>This world that always hated me!</p>

<p>Take an eye for an eye.</p>

<p>Turn your heart into stone.</p>

<p>This is all I have lived for.</p>

<p>This is all I have known.</p>

<p>One word from him and I’d be back</p>

<p>Beneath the lash, upon the rack.</p>

<p>Instead, he offers me my freedom.</p>

<p>I feel my shame inside me like a knife.</p>

<p>He told me that I have a soul.</p>

<p>How does he know?</p>

<p>What spirit comes to move my life?</p>

<p>Is there another way to go?</p>

<p>I am reaching, but I fall,</p>

<p>And the night is closing in,</p>

<p>And I stare into the void —</p>

<p>To the whirlpool of my sin.</p>

<p>I’ll escape now from the world</p>

<p>From the world of Jean Valjean</p>

<p>Jean Valjean is nothing now.</p>

<p>Another story must begin!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="at-the-end-of-the-day">AT THE END OF THE DAY</h3>

<p><strong>THE POOR</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the day you’re another day older</p>

<p>And that’s all you can I say for the life of the poor</p>

<p>It’s a struggle, it’s a war</p>

<p>And there’s nothing that anyone’s giving</p>

<p>One more day standing about</p>

<p>What is it for?</p>

<p>One day less to be living!</p>

<p>At the end of the day you’re another day colder</p>

<p>And the shirt on your back doesn’t keep out the chill</p>

<p>And the righteous hurry past</p>

<p>They don’t hear the little ones crying</p>

<p>And the winter is coming on fast</p>

<p>Ready to kill</p>

<p>One day nearer to dying!</p>

<p>At the end of the day there’s another day dawning</p>

<p>And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise</p>

<p>Like the waves crash on the sand</p>

<p>Like a storm that’ll break any second</p>

<p>There’s a hunger in the land</p>

<p>There’s a reckoning still to be reckoned and</p>

<p>There’s gonna be hell to pay</p>

<p>At the end of the day!</p>

<p><strong>FOREMAN</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing</p>

<p>Sitting flat on your butt doesn’t buy any bread.</p>

<p><strong>WORKERS</strong></p>

<p>There are children back at home</p>

<p>And the children have got to be fed</p>

<p>And you’re lucky to be in a job</p>

<p>And in a bed</p>

<p>And we’re counting our blessings!</p>

<p><strong>WOMEN</strong></p>

<p>Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today</p>

<p>With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?</p>

<p>It’s because little Fantine won’t give him his way</p>

<p>Take a look at his trousers, you see where he stands!</p>

<p><strong>WORKERS</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the day it’s another day over</p>

<p>With enough in your pocket to last for a week</p>

<p>Pay the landlord, pay the shop</p>

<p>Keep on grafting as long as you’re able</p>

<p>Keep on grafting till you drop</p>

<p>Or it’s back to the crumbs off the table</p>

<p>You’ve got to pay your way</p>

<p>At the end of the day!</p>

<p><strong>GIRL</strong></p>

<p>And what have we here, little innocent sister?</p>

<p>Come on Fantine let’s have all the news</p>

<p>“Ooh&amp;mldr;dear Fantine, you must send us more money &amp;mldr;</p>

<p>your child needs a doctor &amp;mldr; There’s no time to lose &amp;mldr; “</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>Give that letter to me</p>

<p>It is none of your business</p>

<p>With a husband at home</p>

<p>And a bit on the side</p>

<p>Is there anyone here</p>

<p>Who can swear before God</p>

<p>She has nothing to fear</p>

<p>She has nothing to hide?</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>What is this fighting all about?</p>

<p>Will someone tear these two apart</p>

<p>This is a factory, not a circus.</p>

<p>Now, come on ladies, settle down</p>

<p>I run a business of repute</p>

<p>I am the Mayor of this town</p>

<p>I look to you to sort this out</p>

<p>And be as patient as you can.</p>

<p><strong>FOREMAN</strong></p>

<p>Now someone say how this began!</p>

<p><strong>GIRL</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the day</p>

<p>She’s the one who began it,</p>

<p>There’s a kid that she’s hiding</p>

<p>In some little town.</p>

<p>There’s a man she has to pay</p>

<p>You can guess how she picks up the extra.</p>

<p>You can bet she’s earning her keep</p>

<p>Sleeping around</p>

<p>And the boss wouldn’t like it!</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>Yes it’s true there’s a child</p>

<p>And the child is my daughter</p>

<p>And her father abandoned us</p>

<p>Leaving us flat.</p>

<p>Now she lives with an innkeeper man</p>

<p>And his wife</p>

<p>And I pay for the child.</p>

<p>What’s the matter with that?</p>

<p><strong>WOMEN</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the day</p>

<p>She’ll be nothing but trouble</p>

<p>And there’s trouble for all</p>

<p>When there’s trouble for one!</p>

<p>While we’re earning our daily bread</p>

<p>She’s the one with her hands in the butter</p>

<p>You must send the slut away</p>

<p>Or we’re all gonna end in the gutter</p>

<p>And it’s us who’ll have to pay</p>

<p>At the end of the day!</p>

<p><strong>FOREMAN</strong></p>

<p>I might have known the bitch could bite</p>

<p>I might have known the cat had claws</p>

<p>I might have guessed your little secret.</p>

<p>Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine</p>

<p>Who keeps herself so pure and clean</p>

<p>You’d be the cause, I had no doubt</p>

<p>Of any trouble hereabout</p>

<p>You play a virgin in the light</p>

<p>But need no urgin’ in the night!</p>

<p><strong>GIRL</strong></p>

<p>She’s been laughing at you</p>

<p>While she’s having her men.</p>

<p><strong>WOMEN</strong></p>

<p>She’ll be nothing but trouble again and again.</p>

<p><strong>WOMAN</strong></p>

<p>You must sack her today.</p>

<p><strong>ALL WORKERS</strong></p>

<p>Sack the girl today</p>

<p><strong>FOREMAN</strong></p>

<p>Right my girl. On your way!</p>

<h3 id="i-dreamed-a-dream">I DREAMED A DREAM</h3>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>There was time when men were kind.</p>

<p>When their voices were soft</p>

<p>And their words inviting.</p>

<p>There was a time when love was blind</p>

<p>And the world was a song</p>

<p>And the song was exciting.</p>

<p>There was a time.</p>

<p>Then it all went wrong.</p>

<p>I dreamed a dream in time gone by</p>

<p>When hope was high</p>

<p>And life worth living</p>

<p>I dreamed that love would never die</p>

<p>I dreamed that God would be forgiving.</p>

<p>Then I was young and unafraid</p>

<p>And dreams were made and used</p>

<p>And wasted</p>

<p>There was no ransom to be paid</p>

<p>No song unsung</p>

<p>No wine untasted.</p>

<p>But the tigers come at night</p>

<p>With their voices soft as thunder</p>

<p>As they tear your hope apart</p>

<p>As they turn your dream to shame.</p>

<p>He slept a summer by my side</p>

<p>He filled my days</p>

<p>With endless wonder</p>

<p>He took my childhood in his stride</p>

<p>But he was gone when autumn came.</p>

<p>And still I dream he’ll come to me</p>

<p>That we will live the years together</p>

<p>But there are dreams that cannot be</p>

<p>And there are storms</p>

<p>We cannot weather . . .</p>

<p>I had a dream my life would be</p>

<p>So different from this hell I’m living</p>

<p>So different now from what it seemed</p>

<p>Now life has killed</p>

<p>The dream I dreamed.</p>

<p>The usual price</p>

<p>Is this a trick? I won’t pay more!</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>No, no, not at all</p>

<p><strong>SAILOR</strong></p>

<p>You’ve got some nerve, you little whore</p>

<p>You’ve got some gall.</p>

<p>It’s the same with a tart</p>

<p>As it is with a grocer—</p>

<p>The customer sees what he gets in advance</p>

<p>It’s not for the whore to say ‘yes sir’ or ’no sir’</p>

<p>It’s not for the harlot to pick or to choose or to lead in the dance</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>I’ll kill you, you bastard</p>

<p>Try any of that!</p>

<p>Even a whore who has gone to the bird</p>

<p>Won’t be had by a rat</p>

<p>Who saw what, and why, and where?</p>

<p>Let him a give a full description</p>

<p>Let him answer to Javert!</p>

<p>In this nest of whores and vipers</p>

<p>Let one speak who saw it all</p>

<p>Who laid hands on this good man here?</p>

<p>What’s the substance of this brawl?</p>

<p><strong>SAILOR</strong></p>

<p>Javert, would you believe it—</p>

<p>I was crossing from the park</p>

<p>When this prostitute attacked me</p>

<p>You can see she left her mark</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>She will answer for her actions</p>

<p>When you make a full report</p>

<p>You may rest assured, M’sieur</p>

<p>That she will answer to the court</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>There’s a child who sorely needs me</p>

<p>Please, M’sieur, she’s but ’that high’</p>

<p>Holy God, is there no mercy?</p>

<p>If I go to jail she’ll die!</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>I have heard such protestations</p>

<p>Every day for twenty years</p>

<p>Let’s have no more explanations</p>

<p>Save your breath, and save your tears’ honest work.</p>

<p>Just reward.</p>

<p>That’s the way to please the lord.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>A moment of your time, Javert</p>

<p>I do believe this woman’s tale</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>But M’sieur Mayor!</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>You’ve done your duty, let her be</p>

<p>She needs a doctor, not a jail</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>But M’sieur Mayor</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Where will she end</p>

<p>This child without a friend?</p>

<p>I’ve seen your face before</p>

<p>Show me some way to help you</p>

<p>How have you come to grief</p>

<p>In such a place as this?</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>M’sieur, don’t mock me now I pray</p>

<p>It’s hard enough, I’ve lost my pride</p>

<p>You let your foreman send me away</p>

<p>Yes you were there and turned aside</p>

<p>I never did no wrong!</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Is it true what I’ve done?</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>My daughter’s close to dying&amp;mldr;</p>

<p>I don’t believe what I see</p>

<p>A man your age</p>

<p>To be as strong as you are</p>

<p>A mem’ry stirs</p>

<p>You make me think of a man</p>

<p>From years ago</p>

<p>A man who broke his parole</p>

<p>He disappeared</p>

<p>Forgive me, sir</p>

<p>I would not dare</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Say what you must</p>

<p>Don’t leave it there</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>I have only known one other</p>

<p>Who can do what you have done</p>

<p>He’s a convict from the chain gang</p>

<p>He’s been ten years on the run</p>

<p>But he couldn’t run forever</p>

<p>We have found his hide-away</p>

<p>And he’s just been rearrested</p>

<p>And he comes to court today</p>

<p>But, of course, he now denies it—</p>

<p>You’d expect that of a ‘con’</p>

<p>Why should I save his hide?</p>

<p>Why should I right this wrong</p>

<p>When I have come so far</p>

<p>And struggled for so long?</p>

<p>If I speak, I am condemned</p>

<p>If I stay silent, I am damned!</p>

<p>I am the master of hundreds of workers.</p>

<p>They all look to me.</p>

<p>Can I abandon them?</p>

<p>How would they live</p>

<p>If I am not free</p>

<p>If I speak, I am condemned.</p>

<p>If I stay silent, I am damned!</p>

<p>Who am I?</p>

<p>Can I condemn this man to slavery?</p>

<p>Pretend I do not see his agony?</p>

<p>This innocent who bears my face</p>

<p>Who goes to judgment in my place.</p>

<p>Who am I?</p>

<p>Can I conceal myself for evermore?</p>

<p>Pretend I’m not the man I was before?</p>

<p>And must my name until I die</p>

<p>Be no more than an alibi?</p>

<p>Must I lie?</p>

<p>How can I ever face my fellow men?</p>

<p>How can I ever face myself again?</p>

<p>My soul belongs to God, I know</p>

<p>I made that bargain long ago</p>

<p>He gave me hope when hope was gone</p>

<p>He gave me strength to journey on</p>

<p>Who am I? Who am I?</p>

<p>I am Jean Valjean!</p>

<p>I tell you there’s nothing here for you</p>

<p>Just the old man and the girl,</p>

<p>They live ordinary lives.</p>

<p><strong>THENARDIER</strong></p>

<p>Don’t interfere</p>

<p>You’ve got some gall</p>

<p>Take care, young miss</p>

<p>MONTPARNASSE</p>

<p>Go home. ‘Ponine</p>

<p>Go home, you’re in the way.</p>

<p><strong>EPONINE</strong></p>

<p>I’m gonna scream. I’m gonna warn them here.</p>

<p><strong>THENARDIER</strong></p>

<p>One little scream and you’ll regret it</p>

<p>For a year.</p>

<p><strong>CLAQUESOUS</strong></p>

<p>What a palaver</p>

<p>What an absolute treat</p>

<p>To watch a cat and it’s father</p>

<p>Pick a bone in the street.</p>

<p><strong>BRUJON</strong></p>

<p>Not a sound out of you!</p>

<p><strong>EPONINE</strong></p>

<p>Well. I told you I’d do it</p>

<p>Told you I’d do it&amp;mldr;</p>

<p><strong>THENARDIER</strong></p>

<p>You wait my girl, you’ll rue this night</p>

<p>I’ll make you scream. You’ll scream alright.</p>

<p>Leave her to me. Don’t wait around.</p>

<p>Make for the sewers. Go underground.</p>

<p><strong>MARIUS</strong></p>

<p>It was your cry sent them away</p>

<p>Once more ‘Ponine, saving the day!</p>

<p>Dearest Cosette—my friend ‘Ponine</p>

<p>Brought me to you</p>

<p>Showed me the way!</p>

<p>Someone is near</p>

<p>Let’s not be seen</p>

<p>Somebody’s here.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>My dear Cosette</p>

<p>I heard a cry in the dark</p>

<p>I heard the shout of angry voices in the street</p>

<p><strong>COSETTE</strong></p>

<p>That was my cry you heard, Papa</p>

<p>I was afraid of what they’d do</p>

<p>They ran away when they heard my cry</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Cosette, my child, what will become of you?</p>

<p><strong>COSETTE</strong></p>

<p>Three men I saw beyond the wall</p>

<p>Three men in shadow moving fast!</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>This was a warning to us all</p>

<p>These were the shadows of the past!</p>

<p>Must be Javert!</p>

<p>He’s found my cover at last</p>

<p>I’ve got to take Cosette away</p>

<p>Before they return</p>

<p>We must get away from shadows</p>

<p>That will never let us be</p>

<p>Tomorrow to Calais,</p>

<p>And then a ship across the sea!</p>

<p>Hurry, Cosette, prepare to leave and say no more</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we’ll away!</p>

<p>Hurry, Cosette, it’s time to close another door</p>

<p>And live another day!</p>

<h3 id="on-my-own">ON MY OWN</h3>

<p><strong>EPONINE</strong></p>

<p>And now I’m all alone again</p>

<p>Nowhere to turn, no one to go to</p>

<p>Without a home, without a friend</p>

<p>Without a face to say hello to</p>

<p>And now the night is near, now I can make</p>

<p>Believe he’s here.</p>

<p>Sometimes I walk alone at night</p>

<p>When everybody else is sleeping</p>

<p>I think of him and then I’m happy</p>

<p>With the company I’m keeping</p>

<p>The city goes to bed</p>

<p>And I can live inside my head.</p>

<p>On my own</p>

<p>Pretending he’s beside me.</p>

<p>All alone, I walk with him till morning</p>

<p>Without him</p>

<p>I feel his arms around me</p>

<p>And when I lose my way I close my eyes</p>

<p>And he has found me.</p>

<p>In the rain the pavement shines like silver</p>

<p>All the lights are misty in the river</p>

<p>In the darkness the trees are full of starlight</p>

<p>And all I see is him and me for ever and forever.</p>

<p>And I know it’s only in my mind</p>

<p>That I’m talking to myself and not to him</p>

<p>And although I know that he is blind</p>

<p>Still I say there’s a way for us.</p>

<p>I love him</p>

<p>But when the night is over</p>

<p>He is gone, the river’s just a river</p>

<p>Without him the world around me changes</p>

<p>The trees are bare and everywhere</p>

<p>The streets are full of strangers.</p>

<p>I love him</p>

<p>But everyday I’m learning</p>

<p>All my life I’ve only been pretending</p>

<p>Without me his world will go on turning</p>

<p>A world that’s full of happiness that I have never known.</p>

<p>I love him, I love him.</p>

<p>I love him, but only on my own.</p>

<p>Let us die facing our foe—</p>

<p>Make them bleed while we can</p>

<p><strong>COMBEFERRE</strong></p>

<p>Make ’em pay through the nose.</p>

<p>Make ’em pay for every man.</p>

<p>Let others rise</p>

<p>To take our place</p>

<p>Until the earth is free!</p>

<p>Here’s a hint of gold</p>

<p>Stuck into a tooth</p>

<p>Pardon me. M’sieur</p>

<p>You won’t be needing this no more.</p>

<p>Shouldn’t be too hard to sell</p>

<p>Add it to the pile</p>

<p>Add it to the stock</p>

<p>Here among the sewer rats</p>

<p>A breath away from Hell</p>

<p>Y’ get accustomed to the smell.</p>

<p>Well someone’s got to clean them up, my friends</p>

<p>Bodies on the highway</p>

<p>Law and order upside down</p>

<p>Someone’s got to collect their odds and ends</p>

<p>As a service to the town</p>

<p>Here’s a tasty ring</p>

<p>Pretty little thing</p>

<p>Wouldn’t want to waste it</p>

<p>That would really be a crime.</p>

<p>Thank you sir, I’m in your debt</p>

<p>Here’s a little toy</p>

<p>Take it off the boy</p>

<p>His heart’s no longer going</p>

<p>And he’s lived his little time</p>

<p>But his watch is ticking yet!</p>

<p>Well someone’s got to clean them up, my friends</p>

<p>Before the little harvest</p>

<p>Disappears into the mud</p>

<p>Someone’s got to collect their odds and ends</p>

<p>When the gutters run with blood</p>

<p>It’s a world where the dogs eat the dogs</p>

<p>Where they kill for the bones in the street</p>

<p>And God in His Heaven</p>

<p>He don’t interfere</p>

<p>‘Cos he’s dead as the stiffs at my feet.</p>

<p>I raise my eyes to see the heavens</p>

<p>And only the moon looks down.</p>

<p>The harvest moon shines down.</p>

<h3 id="javerts-suicide">JAVERT’S SUICIDE</h3>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>It’s you Javert</p>

<p>I knew you wouldn’t wait too long</p>

<p>The faithful servant at his post once more</p>

<p>This man’s done no wrong</p>

<p>And he needs a doctor’s care.</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>I warned you I would not give IN,</p>

<p>I won’t be swayed.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Another hour yet and then I’m yours</p>

<p>And all our debts are paid.</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>The man of mercy</p>

<p>Comes again</p>

<p>And talks of justice.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Come, time is running short</p>

<p>Look down, Javert,</p>

<p>He’s standing in his grave</p>

<p>Give way, Javert,</p>

<p>There is a life to save.</p>

<p><strong>JAVERT</strong></p>

<p>Take him, Valjean</p>

<p>Before I change my mind.</p>

<p>I will be waiting</p>

<ol>
  <li>Who is this man?</li>
</ol>

<p>What sort of devil is he</p>

<p>To have me caught in a trap</p>

<p>And choose to let me go free?</p>

<p>It was his hour at last</p>

<p>To put a seal on my fate</p>

<p>Wipe out the past</p>

<p>And wash me clean off the slate!</p>

<p>All it would take</p>

<p>Was a flick of his knife.</p>

<p>Vengeance was his and he gave me back my life!</p>

<p>Damned if I’ll live in the debt of a thief</p>

<p>Damned if I’ll yield at the end of the chase</p>

<p>I am the Law and the Law is not mocked</p>

<p>I’ll spit his pity right back in his face</p>

<p>There is nothing on earth that we share</p>

<p>It is either Valjean or Javert!</p>

<p>How can I now allow this man</p>

<p>To hold dominion over me?</p>

<p>This desperate man that I have hunted</p>

<p>He gave me my life. He gave me freedom.</p>

<p>I should have perished by his hand</p>

<p>It was his right</p>

<p>It was my right to die as well.</p>

<p>Instead, I live &amp;mldr; but live in hell.</p>

<p>And my thoughts fly apart</p>

<p>Can this man be believed?</p>

<p>Shall his sins be forgiven?</p>

<p>Shall his crimes be reprieved?</p>

<p>And must I now begin to doubt.</p>

<p>Who never doubted all these years?</p>

<p>My heart is stone and still it trembles</p>

<p>The world I have known is lost in shadow</p>

<p>Is he from heaven or from hell?</p>

<p>And does he know</p>

<p>That, granting me my life today</p>

<p>This man has killed me even so?</p>

<p>I am reaching but I fall</p>

<p>And the stars are black and cold</p>

<p>As I stare into the void</p>

<p>Of a world that cannot hold</p>

<p>I’ll escape now from the world</p>

<p>From the world of Jean Valjean</p>

<p>There is nowhere I can turn</p>

<p>There is no way to go on&amp;mldr;</p>

<p><strong>WOMEN</strong></p>

<p>Did you see them</p>

<p>Going off to fight</p>

<p>Children of the barricades</p>

<p>Who didn’t last the night?</p>

<p>Did you see them</p>

<p>Lying where they died?</p>

<p>Someone used to cradle them</p>

<p>And kiss them when they cried</p>

<p>Did you see them lying side by side?</p>

<p>Who will wake them?</p>

<p>No one ever will</p>

<p>No one ever told them</p>

<p>That a summer day can kill</p>

<p>They were school boys</p>

<p>Never held a gun</p>

<p>Fighting for a new world</p>

<p>That would rise up like the sun.</p>

<p>Where’s that new world now the fighting’s done?</p>

<p>Nothing changes. Nothing ever will.</p>

<p>Every year another brat, another mouth to fill</p>

<p>Same old story. What’s the use of tears?</p>

<p>What’s the use of praying</p>

<p>If there’s nobody who hears?</p>

<p>Turning turning turning turning turning</p>

<p>Through the years</p>

<p>Turning, turning, turning through the years.</p>

<p>Minutes into hours, and the hours into years.</p>

<p>Nothing changes. Nothing ever can</p>

<p>Round about the roundabout, and back where you began.</p>

<p>Round and round and back where you began!</p>

<p><strong>MARIUS</strong></p>

<p>There’s a grief that can’t be spoken</p>

<p>There’s a pain goes on and on</p>

<p>Empty chairs at empty tables</p>

<p>Now my friends are dead and gone</p>

<p>Here they talked of revolution</p>

<p>Here it was they lit the flame</p>

<p>Here they sang about ’tomorrow’</p>

<p>And tomorrow never came.</p>

<p>From the table in the corner</p>

<p>They could see a world reborn</p>

<p>And they rose with voices ringing</p>

<p>I can hear them now</p>

<p>The very words that they had sung</p>

<p>Became their last communion</p>

<p>On the lonely barricade at dawn!</p>

<p>Oh my friends, my friends, forgive me</p>

<p>That I live and you are gone</p>

<p>There’s a grief that can’t be spoken</p>

<p>There’s a pain goes on and on</p>

<p>Phantom faces at the window</p>

<p>Phantom shadows on the floor</p>

<p>Empty chairs at empty tables</p>

<p>Where my friends will meet no more,</p>

<p>Oh my friends, my friends, don’t ask me</p>

<p>What your sacrifice was for</p>

<p>Empty chairs at empty tables</p>

<p>Where my friends will sing no more.</p>

<p>Don’t think about it, Marius!</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Alone I wait in the shadows</p>

<p>I count the hours till I can sleep</p>

<p>I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by</p>

<p>It made her weep</p>

<p>To know I die</p>

<p>Alone, at the end of the day</p>

<p>Upon this wedding night I pray</p>

<p>Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace</p>

<p>And show them grace.</p>

<p>God on high,</p>

<p>Hear my prayer</p>

<p>Take me now</p>

<p>To thy care</p>

<p>Where you are.</p>

<p>Let me be,</p>

<p>Take me now,</p>

<p>Take me there</p>

<p>Bring me home,</p>

<p>Bring me home</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>Mssr. I bless your name.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>I am ready, Fontaine.</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>Mssr. lay down your burden.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>At the end of my days.</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>You raised my child with love</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>She’s the best of my life</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>And you will be with God.</p>

<p><strong>COSETTE</strong></p>

<p>Papa, Papa I do not understand</p>

<p>Are you all right? They said you’d gone away.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Cosette, my child, am I forgiven now?</p>

<p>Thank God, thank God, I’ve lived to see this day.</p>

<p><strong>MARIUS</strong></p>

<p>It’s you who must forgive a thoughtless fool.</p>

<p>It’s you who must forgive a thankless man.</p>

<p>It’s thanks to you that I am living</p>

<p>And again I lay down my life at your feet.</p>

<p>Cosette, your father is a saint.</p>

<p>When they wounded me</p>

<p>He took me from the barricade</p>

<p>Carried like a babe, and brought me home to you!</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Now you are here,</p>

<p>Again beside me.</p>

<p>Now I can die in peace</p>

<p>For now my life is blessed&amp;mldr;</p>

<p>You will live, Papa, you’re going to live.</p>

<p>It’s too soon, too soon to say good-bye!</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Yes, Cosette, forbid me not to die.</p>

<p>I’ll obey,</p>

<p>I will try.</p>

<p>On this page</p>

<p>I write my last confession.</p>

<p>Read it well</p>

<p>When I, at last, am sleeping</p>

<p>It’s a story</p>

<p>Of those who always loved you.</p>

<p>Your mother gave her life for you</p>

<p>Then gave you to my keeping.</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE</strong></p>

<p>Come with me</p>

<p>Where chains will never bind you</p>

<p>All your grief,</p>

<p>Your grief, at last, behind you</p>

<p>Lord in heaven,</p>

<p>Look down on him in mercy.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN</strong></p>

<p>Forgive me all my trespasses</p>

<p>And take me to your glory.</p>

<p><strong>FANTINE, EPONINE</strong></p>

<p>Take my hand</p>

<p>And lead me to salvation</p>

<p>Take my love</p>

<p>For love is everlasting.</p>

<p><strong>VALJEAN, FANTINE &amp; EPONINE</strong></p>

<p>And remember</p>

<p>The truth that once was spoken,</p>

<p>To love another person</p>

<p>Is to see the face of God.</p>

<p><strong>CHORUS</strong></p>

<p>Do you hear the people sing</p>

<p>Lost in the valley of the night?</p>

<p>It is the music of the people</p>

<p>Who are climbing to the light</p>

<p>For the wretched of the earth</p>

<p>There is a flame that never dies</p>

<p>Even the darkest night will end</p>

<p>And the sun will rise.</p>

<p>They will live again in freedom</p>

<p>In the garden of the Lord</p>

<p>They will walk behind their plowshare</p>

<p>They will put away the sword</p>

<p>Their chain will be broken and</p>

<p>All men will have their reward</p>

<p>Will you join in our crusade?</p>

<p>Who will be strong and stand with me?</p>

<p>Somewhere beyond the barricade</p>

<p>Is there a world you long to see?</p>

<p>Do you hear the people sing?</p>

<p>Say do you hear the distant drums?</p>

<p>It is the future that they bring</p>

<p>When tomorrow comes!</p>

<p>Oh, tomorrow comes!</p>
